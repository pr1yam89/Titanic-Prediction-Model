        <h2>About Tragedy </h2>
        <div>
            <pre>
            The RMS Titanic sank in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean, 
            four days into her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The largest ocean liner in service 
            at the time, Titanic had an estimated 2,224 people on board when she struck an iceberg at around 23:40 
            (ship's time)[a] on Sunday, 14 April 1912. Her sinking two hours and forty minutes later at 02:20 
            (ship's time; 05:18 GMT) on Monday, 15 April, resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, 
            making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.
            
            Titanic received six warnings of sea ice on 14 April but was travelling about 22 knots when her 
            lookouts sighted the iceberg. Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow 
            that buckled her starboard side and opened six of her sixteen compartments to the sea. Titanic 
            had been designed to stay afloat with four of her forward compartments flooded but no more, and the 
            crew soon realised that the ship would sink. They used distress flares and radio (wireless) messages 
            to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats.

            In accordance with existing practice, Titanic's lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to 
            nearby rescue vessels, not to hold everyone on board simultaneously; therefore, with the ship sinking 
            rapidly and help still hours away, there was no safe refuge for many of the passengers and crew with 
            only 20 lifeboats, including 4 collapsible lifeboats. Poor management of the evacuation meant many 
            boats were launched before they were completely full.

            Titanic sank with over a thousand passengers and crew still on board. Almost all of those who jumped 
            or fell into the water drowned or died within minutes due to the effects of cold shock and 
            incapacitation. RMS Carpathia arrived about an hour and a half after the sinking and rescued all of 
            the 710 survivors by 09:15 on 15 April, some nine and a half hours after the collision. The disaster 
            shocked the world and caused widespread outrage over the lack of lifeboats, lax regulations, and the 
            unequal treatment of the third class passengers during the evacuation. Subsequent inquiries 
            recommended sweeping changes to maritime regulations, leading to the establishment in 1914 of the 
            International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS).

        <h2>About Titanic Prediction Model </h2>
        <div>
            <pre>
                Using Machine learning model we predict whether the passenger will survive the tragedy or not.
                On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after 
                colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, 
                resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
                
                While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were 
                more likely to survive than others.

                In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts 
                of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
